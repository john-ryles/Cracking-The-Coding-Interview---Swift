# Cracking The Coding Interview (6th Edition) - Swift

This repo includes updated Swift (5.3) solutions to the Cracking the Coding Interview book (6th Edition).

These solutions are my own interpretation of how I would solve these problems. I have no affiliation with the book and am only posting these to help my fellow iOS developers out there that are looking to land their dream job.
